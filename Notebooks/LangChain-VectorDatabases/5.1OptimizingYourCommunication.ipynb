    "In the ever-evolving world of chatbot applications, maintaining message history can be essential for delivering context-aware responses that enhance user experiences. In this article, we will dive into the realm of Python and LangChain and explore two exemplary scenarios that highlight the importance of message history tracking and how it can improve chatbot interactions."

Short-term memory is used for temporary storage of information, such as remembering a phone number or a list of items. Long-term memory is used for storing information for a longer period of time, such as memories from childhood or important facts. Working memory is used for actively processing and manipulating information, such as solving a math problem or following instructions. The type of memory to use depends on the task at hand.
