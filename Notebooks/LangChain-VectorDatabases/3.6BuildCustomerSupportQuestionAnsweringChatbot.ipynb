    "## Build a Customer Support Question Answering Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "As we witness accelerated technological progress, large language models like GPT-4 and ChatGPT have emerged as significant breakthroughs in the tech landscape. These state-of-the-art models demonstrate exceptional prowess in content generation. However, they are not without their share of challenges, such as biases and hallucinations. Despite these limitations, LLMs have the potential to bring about a transformative impact on chatbot development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional, primarily intent-based chatbots have been designed to respond to specific user intents. These intents comprise a collection of sample questions and corresponding responses. For instance, a \"Restaurant Recommendations\" intent might include sample questions like \"Can you suggest a good Italian restaurant nearby?\" or \"Where can I find the best sushi in town?\" with responses such as \"You can try the Italian restaurant 'La Trattoria' nearby\" or \"The top-rated sushi place in town is 'Sushi Palace.'\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When users interact with the chatbot, their queries are matched to the most similar intent, generating the associated response. However, as LLMs continue to evolve, chatbot development is shifting toward more sophisticated and dynamic solutions capable of handling a broader range of user inquiries with greater precision and nuance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Having a Knowledge Base\n",
    "LLMs can significantly enhance chatbot functionality by associating broader intents with documents from a Knowledge Base (KB) instead of specific questions and answers. This approach streamlines intent management and generates more tailored responses to user inquiries.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT3 has a maximum prompt size of around 4,000 tokens, which is substantial but insufficient for incorporating an entire knowledge base in a single prompt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future LLMs may not have this limitation while retaining the text generation capabilities. However, for now, we need to design a solution around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "This project aims to build a chatbot that leverages GPT3 to search for answers within documents. The workflow for the experiment is explained in the following diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../images/CustomerQAChatbot.png\" width=400 height=100 />\n",
    "\n",
    "First we scrape some content from online articles, we split them into small chunks, compute their embeddings and store them in Deep Lake. Then, we use a user query to retrieve the most relevant chunks from Deep Lake, we put them into a prompt, which will be used to generate the final answer by the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that there is always a risk of generating hallucinations or false information when using LLMs. Although this might not be acceptable for many customers support use cases, the chatbot can still be helpful for assisting operators in drafting answers that they can double-check before sending them to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "As we’re going to use the `SeleniumURLLoader` LangChain class, and it uses the unstructured and selenium Python library, let’s install it using `pip`. It is recommended to install the latest version of the library."

NFT stands for Non-fungible Token. Fungible by its very definition means something that is mutually interchangeable. For example, you can exchange a $10 note with another $10 note or exchange it with two $5 notes. In both cases, the value remains the same and you will have no problem exchanging the money. Here, money is a fungible item as it can be exchanged without diminishing the value.', metadata={'source': 'https://beebom.com/what-is-nft-explained/', 'title': 'NFTs Explained: What is an NFT and What is Its Use | Beebom', 'description': 'Wondering what is non fungible token? We have explained NFTs, and tell you how you can buy, make and sell your own NFTs easily.', 'language': 'en-US'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='So when we say Non-fungible, it means something that can’t be exchanged with a similar item of similar value. To give you a simple example, if you want to replace the Mona Lisa painting kept in Louvre, Paris with another printout of the same image, will it be the same? And more importantly, will it hold the same value? The answer is no. Here, the incomparable Mona Lisa painting is a Non-fungible item that can’t be exchanged with another item having an identical appearance.', metadata={'source': 'https://beebom.com/what-is-nft-explained/', 'title': 'NFTs Explained: What is an NFT and What is Its Use | Beebom', 'description': 'Wondering what is non fungible token? We have explained NFTs, and tell you how you can buy, make and sell your own NFTs easily.', 'language': 'en-US'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Uniqueness is the key here. A Non-fungible item is, therefore, something that is unique and authentic. Something that holds value for its authenticity. Now we come to the token part. A token is a 40-digit string of words and numbers that hold the information of the original artist who created the masterpiece, the current owner of the item (it can only be one), and the current price of the item. This storage of information is backed by Blockchain technology which can’t be altered by any means due to its decentralized system.\\n\\nFinally, when you put all three words together, NFT means an incorruptible token that holds ownership information about an item that is unique and authentic. NFT is basically a certificate of ownership or authenticity. This is the general definition of NFT, but if you want to get a complete idea about NFTs then you need to understand the concept with digital art as an example, which I have covered in the next section.\\n\\nWhat is the Use of NFT in Digital Art?', metadata={'source': 'https://beebom.com/what-is-nft-explained/', 'title': 'NFTs Explained: What is an NFT and What is Its Use | Beebom', 'description': 'Wondering what is non fungible token?

       " Document(page_content='Many must be wondering what is the use of NFT in digital art and why is there so much hullabaloo about it? Well, as I explained in the above section that NFT is a signature of authenticity and it provides that authentic stamp of approval on the web while dealing with digital arts. We all know, in today’s world anything can be tampered with and people can pass off others’ work as theirs. Basically, on the web, it’s next to impossible to find the original creator of an artwork and that’s where NFTs come into the play. NFTs pretty much aim to bring art collecting into the digital age with completely digital art that is sold as NFTs.', metadata={'source': 'https://beebom.com/what-is-nft-explained/', 'title': 'NFTs Explained: What is an NFT and What is Its Use | Beebom', 'description': 'Wondering what is non fungible token?

       " Document(page_content='NFT provides a means for digital creators to put their work in the public domain without having to worry about proving ownership or authenticity. Digital artists can generate NFT for their original work and auction it off to another person while maintaining the information about the original creator, the current owner, and the current value.

Another aspect of this technology is that it creates a chain which means everything is traceable right to the original creator.\\n\\nOne thing to note is that you can only buy NFTs with cryptocurrency and particularly, from Ethereum.

       " Document(page_content='Now that we have learned about NFT in detail, let’s find out how NFT was originated. First off, the reason Ethereum has an early headstart is because they were the ones who started this project with their new NFT blockchain system called ERC-721 in 2015. Subsequent to that, Ethereum brought ERC-1155 and advanced the technology before Bitcoin and Flow could catch up.\\n\\nIn what was the first introduction of NFT to the masses, in 2017, Ethereum introduced a blockchain game called CryptoKitties. In this game, players could purchase, collect, breed, and sell virtual cats using Ether (Ethereum’s cryptocurrency).

Now with the current boom, it’s anyone’s guess where the market will go from here.\\n\\nThe Cons of NFT\\n\\nWhile we discussed the pros of NFT from above and beyond, there are some major cons that you should keep in mind before investing in a digital collectible through NFT. First off, it takes up an enormous amount of energy to generate and maintain the system which makes it unsustainable and makes a negative impact on the ecology. It’s because, unlike cryptocurrency, a non-fungible token runs on a proof-of-work blockchain which is less energy-efficient. As an aside, expect GPU prices to go even higher in the near future due to extreme mining.', metadata={'source': 'https://beebom.com/what-is-nft-explained/', 'title': 'NFTs Explained: What is an NFT and What is Its Use | Beebom', 'description': 'Wondering what is non fungible token?

       " Document(page_content='Apart from that, critics warn that NFT is a bubble, and people who are buying a strange GIF or collecting a rare video clip at such a high cost will come crashing down. Experts say that paintings and rare collectibles do not hold value just because of the sheer artistry, but also because there is an established audience who want to own and collect rare paintings or an artwork that no other person has.\\n\\nExperts point out that those who are buying digital artwork are not paying huge sums because they appreciate art. Instead, they want to create a bubble to earn money by reselling it at a higher price. It’s worth noting that the digital world does not have a scarcity of artwork — unlike physical masterpieces — so the prices will likely come down once the bubble bursts.\\n\\nHow to Buy NFTs\\n\\nBuying an NFT is as simple as heading to any of the NFT marketplaces, and making a purchase.

    "### Issues with Generating Answers using GPT-3\n",
    "In the previous example, the chatbot generally performs well. However, there are certain situations where it could fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we ask, \"Is the Linux distribution free?\" and provide GPT-3 with a document about kernel features as context. It might generate an answer like \"Yes, the Linux distribution is free to download and use,\" even if such information is not present in the context document. Producing false information is highly undesirable for customer service chatbots!\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-3 is less likely to generate false information when the answer to the user's question is contained within the context. Since user questions are often brief and ambiguous, we cannot always rely on the semantic search step to retrieve the correct document. Thus, there is always a risk of generating false information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "GPT-3 is highly effective in creating conversational chatbots capable of answering specific questions based on the contextual information provided in the prompt. However, it can be challenging to ensure that the model generates answers solely based on the context, as it has a tendency to hallucinate (i.e., generate new, potentially false information). The severity of generating false information varies depending on the use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, we implemented a context-aware question-answering system using LangChain, following the provided code and strategies. The process involved splitting documents into chunks, computing their embeddings, implementing a retriever to find similar chunks, crafting a prompt for GPT-3, and using the GPT3 model for text generation. This approach demonstrates the potential of leveraging GPT-3 to create powerful and contextually accurate chatbots while also highlighting the need to be cautious about the possibility of generating false information."
