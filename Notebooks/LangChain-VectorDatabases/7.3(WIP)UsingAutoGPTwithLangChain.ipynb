    "## Using AutoGPT with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "After covering BabyAGI library in the earlier lesson, we will delve deep into the mechanics of AutoGPT, another popular type of autonomous agent, demonstrating how it employs multiple tools and memory systems to perform and manage tasks autonomously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is AutoGPT\n",
    "Unlike traditional language models that generate text based solely on the input they receive, AutoGPT combines a set of tools and a memory system to interact with its environment, retrieve past interactions, and generate more informed responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGPT distinguishes itself with three critical features. First, its internet connectivity provides real-time access to information, bolstering its research abilities. Second, its planning capability enables it to generate and pursue sub-tasks that contribute to the completion of a main task. Lastly, it has the power to execute tasks, even to the extent of initiating other AI agents. While these features offer huge potential, they also present challenges, such as inadvertent task looping or prematurely assuming task completion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through internet browser plugins and other forms of access, AutoGPT gathers the information needed to execute tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "An external memory serves as its context-aware module, enabling it to understand its current situation, generate new tasks, and even self-correct if necessary. As a result, AutoGPT operates dynamically, continually re-prioritizing tasks based on the context and situation."

    "\n",
    "We initialize different tools that the AI agent can use to complete tasks. In our case, the tools are Search, WriteFileTool, and ReadFileTool. The Search tool utilizes a GoogleSearchAPIWrapper to fetch real-time information from the internet, which can be employed for questions about current events or queries that need up-to-date information. The WriteFileTool and ReadFileTool manage file-related tasks. These tools are collected into a list that will be later passed to the agent. Remember to install the required packages with the following command: `pip install langchain==0.0.208 deeplake openai==0.27.8 tiktoken`"

    "### Agent Memory Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "For the memory, we create the FAISS vector DB (but any other vector DB would work similarly), an efficient similarity search, and clustering of dense vectors. This is paired with an `InMemoryDocstore` instance for storing documents in memory and an `OpenAIEmbeddings` model for creating embeddings of the queries. These tools are crucial for the agent's remembering and retrieving past interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGPT has been designed to operate over longer periods. AutoGPT has incorporated a retrieval-based memory system that functions over intermediate agent steps to do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "This memory performs a semantic search across embeddings using the vector DB. While such retrieval-based memory is a part of LangChain, it was traditionally used for user and agent interactions, not agent and tools. AutoGPT's new adaptation represents a significant shift in how this memory system is applied. If you get the error `Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement faiss (from versions: none)` install the faiss library `pip install faiss-cpu`."
