    "## What are Agents: Agents as Content Generators and Reasoning Engines\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, LangChain and LLMs have opened up new horizons in data analysis, information synthesis, and content generation. Central to their functionality is the concept of Agents - intelligent systems that utilize LLMs to determine actions and facilitate complex tasks. In this way, LLMs are used more as a reasoning engine or a planner and less as content generators per-se. We discuss two primary ways we can harness the capabilities of LMMs: as content generators and as reasoning engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs leverage their internal knowledge as content generators to create engaging and creative content from scratch. On the other hand, used as reasoning engines, they act as proficient synthesizers of information, extracting and summarizing relevant data from a multitude of sources and planning the next actions to take. Both these approaches have distinct advantages and challenges, with the choice largely dependent on the specific requirements of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agents\n",
    "In the context of language models, agents are used to decide the course of action and the sequence of these actions. These actions can either be the utilization of a tool, observing its output, or offering a response to the user. The real potential of agents unfolds when they are utilized appropriately. This explanation aims to simplify the usage of agents via the highest-level API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the practical usage, it's crucial to understand the following terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool:** A function that performs a specific task. It can be a Google Search, a Database lookup, a Python REPL, or other chains. A tool's interface is typically a function that takes a string as an input and returns a string as an output.\n",
    "2. **Language Learning Model:** The language model that powers the agent.\n",
    "3. **Agent:** The agent to use, identified by a string that references a supported agent class. It’s what orchestrates the LLM and the tools. This explanation focuses on using the standard supported agents via the highest-level API. For custom agent implementation, refer to the appropriate documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents in LangChain play a crucial role in the decision-making and execution of tasks based on user input. They evaluate the situation and decide on the appropriate tools to use, if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presently, most of the agents in LangChain fall into one of these two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **\"Action Agents\":** These agents determine and execute a single action. They are typically used for straightforward tasks.\n",
    "+ **\"Plan-and-Execute Agents\":** These agents first devise a plan comprising multiple actions and then execute each action sequentially. They are more suited for complex or long-running tasks as they help maintain focus on long-term objectives.\n",
    "While Action Agents are more traditional and suitable for smaller tasks, Plan-and-Execute Agents help maintain long-term objectives and focus. However, they might lead to more calls and higher latency. Often, it's beneficial to let an Action Agent manage the execution for the Plan-and-Execute agent, thus utilizing both strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a high-level workflow of Action Agents would look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The agent receives user input.\n",
    "2. It decides which tool to use (if any) and determines its input.\n",
    "3. The chosen tool is called with the provided input, and an observation (the output of the tool) is recorded.\n",
    "4. The history of the tool, tool input, and observation are relayed back to the agent, which then decides the next step.\n",
    "5. This process is repeated until the agent no longer needs to use a tool, at which point it directly responds to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most critical abstraction to understand is the agent itself. In the context of LangChain, the term \"agents\" pertains to the concept of employing a language model as a reasoning mechanism and linking it with the key element - a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools are instrumental in connecting the language model with other sources of data or computation, including search engines, APIs, and other data repositories. Language models can only access the knowledge they've been trained on, which can quickly become obsolete. Therefore, tools are essential as they allow the agent to retrieve and incorporate current data into the prompt as context. Tools can also execute actions (like running code or modifying files) and observe the results, subsequently informing the language model's decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said before, we can abstract two primary modes of operation to consider when employing an LLM: as a content generator and as a reasoning engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "When used as a \"content generator,\" the language model is asked to create content entirely from its internal knowledge base. This approach can lead to highly creative outputs but can also result in unverified information or 'hallucinations' due to the model's reliance on pre-trained knowledge.\n",
    "On the other hand, when functioning as a \"reasoning engine,\" the Agent acts more as an information manager rather than a creator. In this mode, it is tasked with gathering relevant, accurate information, often aided by external tools. This involves the LLM drawing from similar resources on a given topic and constructing new content by extracting and summarizing the relevant details."

    "There were 169 goals scored in the soccer world cup in 2018, so the final answer is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, the agent leverages its \"reasoning engine\" capabilities to generate responses. Instead of creating new content (acting as a content generator), the agent uses the tools at its disposal to gather, process, and synthesize information. The entire output was truncated, and the agent skillfully employed the LLM-math tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the steps to see how the agent functions as a \"reasoning engine\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Processing:** The agent receives a query: \"What's the result of 1000 plus the number of goals scored in the soccer world cup in 2018?” The agent identifies two distinct tasks within this query - finding out the number of goals scored in the 2018 soccer world cup and adding 1000 to such number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tool Utilization:** The agent uses the \"google-search\" tool to answer the first part of the query. This is an example of the agent using external tools to gather accurate and relevant information. The agent isn't creating this information; it's pulling the data from an external source.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Information Processing:** For the second part of the query, the agent uses the \"llm-math\" tool to perform a sum reliably. Again, the agent isn't creating new information. Instead, it's processing the data it has gathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Synthesis and Response:** After gathering and processing the information, the agent synthesizes it into a coherent response that answers the original query.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the agent acts as a \"reasoning engine.” It's not generating content from scratch but rather gathering, processing, and synthesizing existing information to generate a response.  This approach allows the agent to provide accurate and relevant responses, making it a powerful tool for tasks that involve data retrieval and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent would create new content as a content generator rather than just pulling and processing existing information. Let's imagine a scenario where we want the agent to write a short science fiction story based on a given prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could initialize the agent with a language model and set its temperature parameter to a higher value to encourage more creativity in its outputs. It is not required to use external tools, as the agent generates content rather than retrieving or processing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The language model will generate a long science fiction story about interstellar explorers based on the patterns it learned during training."
